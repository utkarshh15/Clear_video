ClearFace Reconstructing Faces from Blurry CCTV Footage Using Deep Learning

Project Description:- ClearFace is a powerful machine learning solution that enhances and reconstructs human faces from low-quality or blurry surveillance videos. By utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and perceptual loss functions, this project significantly improves the clarity of footage, helping security professionals and investigators identify suspects with greater accuracy.

This project addresses real-world challenges faced by law enforcement and surveillance teams, where low-quality video footage from CCTV cameras can impede investigations. ClearFace helps convert blurry or distorted videos into clearer, more detailed footage, enabling better facial recognition.

Features:- 1.Enhances blurry surveillance footage to improve face clarity. 2.Utilizes advanced deep learning models (including TensorFlow and VGG16 for perceptual loss). 3.Trains on paired blurry and clear videos to learn effective deblurring. 4.Saves enhanced video in standard formats such as .mp4. 5.Can be trained on new datasets or used with pre-trained models.

Technologies Used:- 1.TensorFlow 2.x: For building and training the machine learning model. 2.Keras: For model architecture and loss functions. 3.OpenCV: For video processing (reading, resizing, and saving frames). 4.VGG16: Pre-trained model for perceptual loss in image deblurring. 5.NumPy: For array manipulation and numerical computations. 6.Matplotlib: For visualizing training history.

Project Structure:- . ├── training_model.py # Script for training the deblurring model. ├── main.py # Script for running the deblurring on a given video. ├── enhanced_deblur_model_tf.h5 # The saved pre-trained model (generated after training). └── README.md # Project documentation.

Training the Model:- To train the deblurring model on your own dataset, you can run the following command: Update the video paths in training_model.py:---- blur_folder = r"PATH/TO/BLUR/VIDEOS" clear_folder = r"PATH/TO/CLEAR/VIDEOS" Run the training script:---- python training_model.py This script will:---- Load your dataset of blurry and clear video pairs. Train the model using a custom loss function (including perceptual loss based on VGG16). Save the trained model as enhanced_deblur_model_tf.h5.

Future Improvements:- 1.Improve model generalization to work with diverse lighting conditions. 2.Add additional features to handle other parts of videos, such as body recognition. 3.Integrate the model with real-time surveillance systems. 4.Explore GANs for further video enhancement capabilities.
